# py-geosupport-html
* This repo provides some html and scripts to allow bulk upload and processing of addresses with NYC's powerful [Geosupport](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-gde-home.page) geocoding software.
* Geosupport is powerful but complex. These scripts let a normal person upload a basic csv with an address and a zip code column to a web page and get back geocoded XY coordinates.
* While rGBAT-html does the same geocoding processing with R (using rGBAT library on the back end), this repo uses Ian Shiland's [python-geosupport](https://github.com/ishiland/python-geosupport/tree/master)
* This is configured for the specific setup on RHEL using apache and python in a conda env. You would have to make adjustments to get it to run elsewhere.

## Usage
* Web browse to where upload.html is being served by your web server.
* Select your data csv file for upload.
* Select the column from the drop-down menu that contains your Addresses
* **You have to have zip codes in a separate column and that column has to be named ZIP_CODE**
    * (I'll fix this so it's selectable eventually.)

## RHEL install notes
* process.py runs as user `apache` on my RHEL server, which I discovered by replacing process.py with this code:
    ```
    import getpass
    print("Content-Type: text/plain\n")
    print("Running as user:", getpass.getuser())
    exit()
    ```
* Install pandas 
    * (Be sure to run process.py locally to catch errors like this before attempting to run it through the html upload. Through html, it will fail silently.)
    * On our server, pandas has to be installed in a conda environment.
        * Use: `conda create -y -p /opt/py-geosupport-conda-env python=3.9 pandas`
        * Change permissions so apache can use the conda env:
            * `sudo chown -R root:apache /opt/py-geosupport-conda-env`
            * `sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/py-geosupport-conda-env`
        * Then make sure your python processing script (process.py) is called (from upload-py.sh) with python from the conda environment:
            * `/opt/py-geosupport-conda-env/bin/python3 process.py ...`
        * Again, check that your python script works locally before trying to do the upload through the html:
            * `sudo -u apache /opt/py-geosupport-conda-env/bin/python3 /var/www/cgi-bin/process.py /tmp/Actual-NYC-addresses-test-data_restaurants.csv Address`
                * (copy your test data file into /tmp and make sure it's readable by apache first)
    * Note: the shebang at the top of process.py is ignored if you call python by path and run this script (like the sudo apache test above and in the edited upload-py.sh). 
        * If you later decide to run this script standalone but need a specific environment (with pandas installed), edit the path of the shebang


## TODO
* Add selectable zip code column.
* Excel instead of csv
* Add other Geosupport field options
* Add support for split addresses? (geosupport can handle it)
